## Features
- Fetch historical weather data from the WeatherAPI.com service
- Analyze and visualize temperature trends over time
- Build and evaluate a linear regression model for temperature prediction
- Generate forecasts for future weather conditions
- Output formatted predictions using templating
- Customizable for specific business locations and requirements

## System Architecture
The application follows a modular design pattern with the following components:

1. **Data Fetcher** - Retrieves historical weather data via API
2. **Weather Plotter** - Visualizes temperature trends
3. **Model Builder** - Creates and evaluates the predictive model
4. **Weather Predictor** - Makes temperature predictions for future conditions
5. **Template Renderer** - Formats prediction results

## Technical Stack
- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning model implementation
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Requests** - API communication
- **Jinja2** - Template rendering

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib requests jinja2
```

### API Key
This project uses the [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) service. You'll need to:
1. Sign up for an account
2. Obtain an API key
3. Replace the placeholder API key in the configuration

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
# Run the main script
python Main.py
```

### Configuration
Update the following parameters in `Main.py` to customize the application:
- `base_url` - API endpoint for weather data
- `api_key` - Your WeatherAPI.com API key
- `city_name` - Location for weather data
- `start_date` and `end_date` - Date range for historical data

### Custom Predictions
To generate predictions for custom weather scenarios:
1. Modify the `future_weather_data.json` file with your test conditions
2. Run the application to generate predictions

### File Structure
- `DataFetcher.py` - Handles API requests and data retrieval
- `WeatherPlotter.py` - Creates visualizations of weather data
- `ModelBuilder.py` - Implements the machine learning model
- `WeatherPredictor.py` - Performs predictions on new data
- `Main.py` - Orchestrates the workflow and components
- `Template.txt` - Jinja2 template for formatting output
- `future_weather_data.json` - Sample data for predictions

### Model Details
The system employs a Linear Regression model to predict temperatures based on:
- Average temperature (F)
- Maximum wind speed (MPH)
- Average humidity (%)

The model is trained on historical data with an 80/20 train/test split.

### Output
The application generates:
1. A visual graph showing temperature trends (`temperature_trends.png`)
2. A text file containing predictions for future weather scenarios (`weather_predictions_output.txt`)

### Example Output
```
Weather Forecast Updates:

    Forecast:
    - Average Temp (F): 84
    - Max Wind (MPH): 6
    - Humidity (%): 45
    - Predicted Temp (F): 88.8

    Forecast:
    - Average Temp (F): 78
    - Max Wind (MPH): 10
    - Humidity (%): 50
    - Predicted Temp (F): 81.0
    
    ...
```

## Customization
### Adding New Features
To incorporate additional weather parameters into the model:
1. Update the `build_and_evaluate_model` method in `ModelBuilder.py`
2. Modify the `predict_future_temperatures` method in `WeatherPredictor.py`
3. Update the JSON structure in `future_weather_data.json`

### Using Different Data Sources
The system can be adapted to use alternative weather data sources by:
1. Creating a new data fetcher class modeled after `DataFetcher.py`
2. Modifying the data processing in `Main.py`

### Business-Specific Customization
- Adjust prediction variables to focus on metrics most relevant to your industry
- Customize output templates for integration with business reporting systems
- Configure alerts based on business-specific weather thresholds

## Limitations
- The current implementation uses a simple linear regression model
- Predictions are based solely on temperature, wind speed, and humidity
- The model does not account for seasonal trends or extreme weather events

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more sophisticated machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Add time series analysis for better trend forecasting
- Include more weather parameters (pressure, precipitation, etc.)
- Create a web interface for real-time predictions
- Develop industry-specific prediction modules (retail, agriculture, energy)
- Implement scenario planning for extreme weather events
